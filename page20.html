    <h2>
        Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency â€“ could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?

    </h2>

    <p>

        If I was more experienced than I am at present then yes, I could have been far more efficient working on my own. The IT tools and systems in place are necessary for the production of websites so I cannot really speak for or against any of them in particular.
        I think I would have benefited from working in a small team as we could have pooled our ideas and designated one another with a particular task or tasks and then joined in putting it together. However, if we had not been tasked with doing this
        singly then we would have missed out on a great learning opportunity.
