        Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites


    </h2>

    <p>

        Appropriate file types for websites depend on the type size and loading speed. Here are some of the better examples:

        <strong>Graphics:</strong>
        <br> JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) = Usually the most compact and quickest to load, although there could be some loss in quality.
        <br> TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) = Good quality but slower to load as it is large.
        <br> PNG (Portable Network Graphics) = With these types of images it is possible to be more creative than with a JPEG. e.g. PNG supports transparency, sometimes necessary when the background needs to be removed without messing up the picture.
        Better quality but the file is larger than a JPEG.
        <br> GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) = These types of files are used to play animated graphics, of short duration.
        <br>

        <strong>Sound:</strong>
        <br> MP3 = This is the usual file type for listening to audio. Good quality and highly compressed.
        <br> WAV = Not such a good choice for audio, best for short duration.
        <br>

        <strong>Sound and Vision:</strong>
        <br> MP4 or MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group ) = These files are good for audio and video, still images, text. Becoming the preferred choice amongst many users.
        <br> AVI (Audio/Video Interleaved) = File has to be completely downloaded before it can be viewed.
        <br>

        <strong>Others:</strong>
        <br> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) = Used for styling websites, basically itâ€™s the painting and decorating of making a website.
        <br> HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) = These are basic commands for composing the skeleton of a website.
        <br> DOC (Microsoft Word Document) = Probably the most commonly used word processing software in the world.
        <br> TXT (Text) = Basically it is just a file composed of text.
        <br> EXE (Executable File) = Usually what downloaded files come as.
        <br> PDF (Portable File Document) = These were created in order to provide uniformity across the Internet for documents.
        <br> ZIP (Zipped File) = Groups of downloadable files are often composed of zip files. You need an extractor to execute them.
