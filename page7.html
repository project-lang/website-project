    <h2>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>
    <p>
        With the increasing use of the Internet for communication, and the increasingly simple ways for information to be disseminated world-wide online with little or no constraints, no matter how private/confidential or explicit, it was becoming apparent there
        was an abuse of the system whereby personal data was being misused with sometimes devastating consequences for the victims. Additionally it was found that some companies/websites were using private individuals personal information in order to
        generate revenue for themselves, often without the consumer being aware of this. Step forward <a href="https://eugdpr.org/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (or GDPR for short). Any country now trading online with a country of the
        EU must comply with the GDPR. It is now far easier for people to understand how their data is being used, and raise any complaints (which now will have a better chance of being listened to). Sites that have no dealings with EU countries can employ
        a blocker to block traffic from the EU in order to prevent them falling foul of the GDPR. It is now incumbent upon businessâ€™ practice data control, and separately, processing:
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>"Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation."</em>
        <br>
        <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-24-gdpr/">Article 24 GDPR</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>"Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject."</em>
        <br>
        <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/">Article 28 GDPR</a>
