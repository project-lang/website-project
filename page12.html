    <h2> Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
    </h2>

    <p>
        People who are blind need to listen to voice commands online. This usually means they also have to listen to every single word of irrelevant information into the bargain as, being unable to see, they cannot just skip ahead. Developers really need to think
        ahead, but not to the bottom line. They need to think ahead and plan how those with visual and/or hearing impairments can access these websites, and feel comfortable on them.

        <em>"UK insurance company Legal & General Group doubled its online traffic in three months when it redesigned its website to make it accessible to disabled people. It recovered the cost of the redesign within 12 months."</em>

        <br> The use of, what can be described as, excessive use of multimedia on websites can be a serious problem for some users with disabilities. Flashing lights, of which a number of websites have them, can cause epileptics to have a seizure, so
        again, care has to be taken when publishing anything on the Internet.

        <em>“...disabled people are subjected to a high-level of abusive behaviour online and offline. This is under-reported and under-prosecuted ...The online space has increased the venues where such abuse can be felt. It means that disabled people can’t escape it, even in their own homes.”</em>
