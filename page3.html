    <h2> Plan and carry out tasks using IT â€“ e.g. making your website.</h2>

    <p>
        Designing my own website from the bottom up turned out to be a little more complicated than I had expected.<br> It had been some years since I'd last used CSS and HTML and although it started to come back to me, I had never used<br> anything like
        Virtual Studio before as I was used to playing with the CSS and HTML on a website that already had<br> the framework in place.<br> The first thing I did was compile a list of the basic things I'd like to see there i.e. The header, sidebar, link
        buttons
        <br> and pages. I then set about planning how I wanted it to look, the colours, and to make sure they complimented each other. From there I decided to deal with the background colour of the page and took a while finding what I was looking for.
        The next thing I worked on was the header, then the sidebar with links.<br> I had a bit of a disaster towards the end of the second day building it, with things suddenly going wrong<br> and spending several hours researching online looking for
        a solution to problems. But I got there in the end<br> although it meant I didn't have the time to make all the little bells and whistles I had hoped to do. However it taught me<br> a lot as well so it wasn't all bad. The final thing I did was
        to check that the website looked the same in both Chrome and Firefox, which it did.
