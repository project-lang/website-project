        Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
    </h2>

    <p>

        Firstly I would make sure that the solutions we were offering matched the technology of the client. This also includes testing solutions on various different browsers and seeing how they operate on them. As many platforms as is reasonable need to be used.
        Then there is the question of which type of people they wish to target, who are they hoping to do business with? There are also financial considerations, and whether the work we do ends up being a waste of time, money, and resources. Additionally,
        the staff. How security conscious are they? How many of them have the word “password” (or some such) as the password on any of the devices they use? These are just a few of the questions that must be addressed, although by no means the only ones.
