    <h2>
        Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?

    </h2>

    <p>
        I am reasonably happy with the tools I used to try to make this website, although in some cases I have flown by the seat of my pants so to speak. Additionally some of the advice I was reading online appeared to be out of date as they referred to HTML
        rather than HTML5, which I had to learn to watch out for. I also had a few minor accidents where making my website was concerned, which also set me back, and was forced to start again only two days before it was due in, but that wasn't the fault
        of the tools I was using. You learn from experience and trial and error.
