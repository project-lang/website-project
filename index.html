        A Little About Me
    </h2>

    <p>

        I have a lot of experience in different environments, including Croupier for about ten years, working in Holland and the UK.<br> Asked to go into management twice I turned it down as I wished to focus on raising my daughter who was two years old
        at the time,and I raised her on my own from her fifth year onwards. I also became a qualified fitness instructor, was made a lifetime member of NABBA (although I preferred not to compete. I have an aversion to (a), being the centre of attention
        and (two), covering myself in what appears to be shoe polish and cooking oil),and additionally practiced two styles of full-contact martial arts for well over ten years. Although I left school with only two 'O' levels (Art and Maths) due to some
        years away from formal education when I lived in Ceylon (SRI Lanka) as a boy, I chose to go back into formal education when I became a single-parent and took an AHE course. This led to me earning a B.A. (Hons) from Manchester, M.Sc. from Liverpool,
        and (everybody needs a hobby) another M.Sc. from UMIST. I have enjoyed playing with computers ever since the ZX Spectrum 48k came out, I still have it, in almost perfect condition. I became more interested in the coding behind websites and such
        about ten years ago and, having the chance to create a website of my own set about teaching myself aspects of CSS and HTML. It was a lot of fun and I loved the ability to be creative, to make something pleasing to the eye, simply using web code.<br>
